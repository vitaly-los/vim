use Ctrl+q to make terminal work again. 

For typing № operation

To enable change in .vimrc file save it :w and then :so % what is meant source file

scriptname  give all info about plugin loag before vim

### vimgrep and quickfix list ###
built-in grep, vimgrep uses vim's quickfix list. see vimcasts#44 for introduction: http://vimcasts.org/episodes/search-multiple-files-with-vimgrep/
```
:vimgrep /<regex>/g %        Search for <regex> with multiple occasions per line (g) 
                             in current file (%)
:vimgrep /<C-r>// %          On the command line, <C-r>/ (that is: CTRL-R followed by /) 
                             will insert the last search pattern.  
:vimgrep /<a>/g <filelist>   Search in the given files (<filelist>) 
:vimgrep /<a>/g *.cc         Search in all *.cc files current directory
:vimgrep /<a>/g **/*.cc      Search in all *.cc files in every sub-directory (recursively) 
:vimgrep /<a>/g `find . -type f`     
                             Search in all files that are returns by the backtick command.
:vim     short for :vimgrep

:cnext   Jump to next record/match in quickfix list
:cprev   Jump to previous record/match in quickfix list
```
Unimpaired plugin (https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired) provides the following mappings:
```
[q       see :cprev
]q       see :cnext
[Q       see :cfirst
]Q       see :clast
```
see also: http://usevim.com/2012/08/24/vim101-quickfix/ and http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/quickfix.html

### Recording ###
Vim has 26 registers (a-z), select the one you want to record in, see below. Exit Record mode with ESC
```
q[a-z]   Start recording, everything will be recorded including movement actions.
@[a-z]   Execute the recorded actions.    
```


### Spell checking ###
See vimcast #19 as an introduction: http://vimcasts.org/episodes/spell-checking/

Assuming that you have the following in .vimrc:
```
nnoremap <silent> <leader>s :set spell!<cr>
```

```
<leader>s Toggle Spelling
]s       Next spelling mistake
[s       Previous spelling mistake
z=       Give Suggestions (prepent 1, use first suggestions automatically)
zg       Add misspelled to spellfile
zug      Remove word from spellfile
```
see http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/spell.html

## Marks ##
Mark a position in a buffer and jump back to it. see also http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Using_marks 
```
ma       set mark a at current cursor location
'a       jump to line of mark a (first non-blank character in line)
`a       jump to position (line and column) of mark a
d'a      delete from current line to line of mark a
d`a      delete from current cursor position to position of mark a
c'a      change text from current line to line of mark a
y`a      yank text to unnamed buffer from cursor to position of mark a
:marks   list all the current marks
:marks aB list marks a, B
```

"====[ Swap : and ; to make colon commands easier to type ]======
nnoremap  ;  :
nnoremap  :  ;


" OR ELSE use the filetype mechanism to select automatically...

    autocmd!
    autocmd FileType  diff   syntax enable
augroup END

" EITHER select by the file-suffix directly...
augroup PatchDiffHighlight
    autocmd!
    autocmd BufEnter  *.patch,*.rej,*.diff   syntax enable

# Key sequences #
#### Replace a word in a number of occurrences with 'bar'; use word under cursor (`*` or `/foo`) ####

# Abbreviations #
auto correction of frequently misspelled words.

:abbr Lunix Linux
:abbr accross across
:abbr hte the
```

# Configuration #
* If you set the **incsearch** option, Vim will show the first match for the pattern, while you are still typing it. This quickly shows a typo in the pattern.
* If you set the __hlsearch__ option, Vim will highlight all matches for the pattern with a yellow background. This gives a quick overview of where the search command will take you. In program code it can show where a variable is used. You don't even have to move the cursor to see the matches.

# NERD-tree #
https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree/blob/master/doc/NERD_tree.txt
```
F3       Toogle NERD-Tree visible 
```

# ctrlp.vim #
https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim
```
C-p      Open ctrlp window (alternative :CtrlP)
:CtrlP d Open CtrlP with specific d = directory
```

```
C-b      Change mode: mru (most recent used) | buffers | files
```

# Formating #
Use `gq` (see Editing section) for formating lines according to configured line-width. 
For C++ formating using clang-format see https://github.com/rhysd/vim-clang-format
